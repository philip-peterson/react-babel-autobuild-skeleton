The simple skeleton for your distributable React components.

About
=====

This is a skeleton for you to create redistributable Node packages for React components using the latest-and-greatest ES6 and Babel extensions. With just a little bit of tweaking though, you could remove the React part and make it work for just generic Node packages.

Key feature: you don't have to distribute minified blobs! It's done automatically for you using the node 'prepublish' hook.
